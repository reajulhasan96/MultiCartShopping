# How many ways can we define a String?--String is a pre-build class in java.
Ans: 2 ways. --(1)String Literal. Ex: String a = "Hello World";
		       (2)By creating object of String. Ex: String s = new String();
		   
# Can we test APIs or web services using selenium webdriver?
Ans: NO, Selenium webdirver uses borwser's native methods to automate the web applications.
	 Since web services are headless, we cannot automate web services by using selenium.
	 
# What are the testing type supported by selenium webdriver?
Ans: Selenium webdriver can be used for performing automated functional and regression testing.
		   
# What is an Xpath?
Ans: Xpath is one of the locators supported by selenium webdriver. Xpath or XML path is a query
	 language for selecting nodes from html documents.

# Difference between Absolute Xpath and Relative Xpath?
Ans: Absolute Xpath:- Locating an element by using an XML expression begins from root node and by 
	traverse parent child node, html node in case of web pages. Slight change of any element, 
	absolute Xpath might fails.
	Relative Xpath:- Locating an element by using an XML expression begins from anywhere in the
	html document. Changes of other element won't effect on relative Xpath. ***Mostly Recommended
	to use the Relative Xpath.***
	
# How can we locate elements using their text in Xpath?
Ans: //tagName[text(), 'the exact text']-- text() is a method and inside '' the exact text present.

# How can we move to nth child element using Xpath?
Ans: There are 2 way. -- (1) Using index. Ex: tagName[2]
						 (2) Using position(). Ex: tagName[position()=3]
						 
# What is syntax of finding element by class/id using CSS Selector?
Ans: Class: Either tagName.className(value of class attribute) or .className(value of class attribute).									
			Selects all the elements with the same class name.
	 ID: Either tagName#id(value of id attribute) or #id(value of id attribute).
	  	  Because id is unique for single element it selects single element.
	  	  
# How can we launch different browsers in selenium webdriver?
Ans: By creating an instance of driver of a particular browser.
	 ex: WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

# What is the difference between close and quit command?
Ans: driver.close() --Use for close the current browser having focus i.e. closes current tab on screen.
	 driver.quit() --Use for close all the browser i.e. closes the whole driver.
	 
# How to switch between multiple windows in selenium?
Ans: Selenium has driver.getWindowHandles() and driver.switchTo().window("windowHandleName") commands
	 to work with multiple windows.
	 The driver.getWindowHandles() command returns list of ids corresponding to each window and on 
	 passing a particular window handle to driver.switchTo().window("windowHandleName") command we can
	 switch control/focus on that particular window.
	 Syntax:
	  for(String windowHandle: driver.getWindowHandles())
	  		{
	  			driver.switchTo().window("windowHandle");
	  		 }
